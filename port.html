                    <h4>Aboutme...</h4>
                    <p>Hello! I'm an extremely driven and creative Full Stack Developer who is currently open for career opportunities as a
                    front-end or back-end web developer in the Greater Seattle Area.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I'm a recent graduate of Coding Dojo, a coding school located in Bellevue, WA that teaches 3 full stacks in 3 months.
                    I'm capable of learning new technologies very quickly, and am always going for opportunities to further expand my
                    skills and grow as a developer.</p>
                    <br>
